# Several tools for neuroimaging
I have recently developed a strong interest in neuroimaging. 
I have been exploring how to read MRI images using R (Elizabeth Sweeney, source("http://neuroconductor.org/neurocLite.R")
 through and have also attempted to create a program that visualizes protein folding based on sequences and predicts binding sites.
